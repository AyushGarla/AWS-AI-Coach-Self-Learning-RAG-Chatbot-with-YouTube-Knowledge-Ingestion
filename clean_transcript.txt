c if c .109 c you c .319 c actually c .560 c work c .980 c regularly c expensive if you actually work regularly expensive if you actually work regularly where .940 c you c .090 c need c .310 c ground c .310 c stations c .000 c or c where you need ground stations or where you need ground stations or antennas .019 c you c .680 c have c .829 c to c .980 c either c .129 c buy c .879 c them c .090 c or c antennas you have to either buy them or antennas you have to either buy them or build .450 c them c .629 c or c .750 c lease c .959 c them c .260 c and c .500 c it's c .709 c very c build them or lease them and it's very build them or lease them and it's very cost .280 c effective c .879 c and c .060 c then c .150 c it's c .690 c all c .989 c a c .019 c very c cost effective and then it's all a very cost effective and then it's all a very cost .680 c it's c .010 c very c .159 c expensive c .489 c i c .760 c should c .939 c say c cost it's very expensive i should say cost it's very expensive i should say it's .239 c not c .359 c cost effective c .840 c and c .319 c then c .439 c up c it's not cost effective and then up it's not cost effective and then up linking .879 c and c .000 c downloading c .720 c data c .930 c is c .349 c also c linking and downloading data is also linking and downloading data is also expensive .609 c so c .819 c that's c .599 c it c .959 c was c .079 c interesting c expensive so that's it was interesting expensive so that's it was interesting to .769 c us c .799 c when c .040 c we c .129 c thought c .340 c about c .400 c that c .819 c and c

which c .510 c ground c work so you figure out which ground work so you figure out which ground station .410 c that c .620 c you're c .740 c gonna c .830 c want c .100 c to c station that you're gonna want to station that you're gonna want to interact .430 c with c .760 c you c .720 c think c .260 c you c .410 c identify c interact with you think you identify interact with you think you identify

c you c .650 c schedule c with and you said you schedule with and you said you schedule effectively .669 c a c .700 c contact c .360 c time c .830 c when c .830 c you c .040 c want c effectively a contact time when you want effectively a contact time when you want that .580 c satellite c .240 c to c .540 c interact c .140 c with c .290 c the c that satellite to interact with the that satellite to interact with the chosen .770 c ground c .130 c station c .610 c when c .760 c that c chosen ground station when that chosen ground station when that satellite .720 c is c .080 c going c .200 c to
