AWS Global Infrastructure refers to the worldwide network of facilities, hardware, and software that supports all AWS services. This infrastructure is purpose-built to provide scalability, reliability, security, and flexibility for customers globally.

## Regions

- A Region is a geographic area that contains multiple, isolated locations known as Availability Zones.
- Regions are designed to be fully independent to provide fault tolerance and stability.
- Users can select a Region to deploy resources close to their end-users or to meet compliance requirements.
- Each Region is physically separated and isolated from every other Region.

## Availability Zones

- An Availability Zone (AZ) is one or more discrete data centers within a Region, each with redundant power, networking, and connectivity.
- AZs are physically separated but close enough to support synchronous data replication.
- Deploying resources across multiple AZs increases reliability and fault tolerance.
- Most Regions have two or more AZs.

## Edge Locations

- Edge Locations are data centers that manage requests for AWS services close to users, mainly for content delivery via Amazon CloudFront and AWS Global Accelerator.
- They cache content and accelerate delivery of web applications, videos, and APIs.
- There are hundreds of Edge Locations worldwide for low-latency connectivity.

## Local Zones

- Local Zones are extensions of AWS Regions that place compute, storage, database, and other select services closer to large population and industry centers.
- They allow latency-sensitive applications to run closer to end users, reducing delay for critical workloads.
- Local Zones are suitable for real-time gaming, multimedia, and hybrid cloud deployments that require local access.

 AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) enables secure access control for AWS resources. IAM lets you manage users, groups, roles, and permissions centrally within your AWS account to ensure only authorized access to services and data.

## IAM Users, Groups, and Roles

- **Users**: Individual identities with credentials (username, password, and optional access keys) for accessing AWS resources. Each user can be assigned specific permissions via policies.
- **Groups**: Collections of users that simplify permission management. Permissions assigned to a group apply to all its members.
- **Roles**: Identities that can be assumed by trusted users, AWS services, or external accounts. Roles provide temporary security credentials and follow the principle of least privilege, often used for delegation or cross-account access.

## IAM Policies

- Policies are documents written in JSON that define permissions for users, groups, and roles.
- Policies specify “Allow” or “Deny” actions on AWS resources, indicating who can perform which operations and under what conditions.
- Policies can be AWS-managed or customer-managed, tailored for organizational requirements.

## Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

- MFA adds an extra layer of security to AWS accounts by requiring an additional form of authentication beyond username and password.
- Supports virtual (software-based) devices, hardware key fobs, and biometric devices.
- Enabling MFA is strongly recommended for AWS root accounts and privileged users to reduce the risk of unauthorized access.

## IAM Best Practices

- Follow the principle of least privilege: grant only the minimum permissions required for tasks.
- Enable MFA for all users, especially the root user.
- Use IAM roles for applications and EC2 instances instead of long-term access keys.
- Regularly review and audit permissions, removing unnecessary users and credentials.
- Rotate credentials and access keys frequently, and avoid embedding them in code or repositories.
- Apply policies at the group or role level instead of directly to users when possible, to simplify management.

 Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud, enabling users to launch virtual servers (instances) for scalable and secure application hosting.

## EC2 Instance Types

- Amazon EC2 offers a variety of instance types optimized for different workloads (compute, memory, storage, and GPU).
- Popular categories include:
  - General Purpose (e.g., t3, m6i): Balanced compute, memory, and networking.
  - Compute Optimized (e.g., c7g): Best for high-performance processing.
  - Memory Optimized (e.g., r6i): Ideal for in-memory databases and analytics.
  - Storage Optimized (e.g., i4i): For workloads requiring high storage throughput.
  - Accelerated Computing (e.g., p4, g6): Suitable for machine learning and high-performance GPU tasks.

## Pricing Models

- **On-Demand Instances**: Pay for compute capacity by the hour or second without long-term commitments; ideal for unpredictable workloads.
- **Reserved Instances**: Commit to one or three years for a discounted rate; best for steady-state usage.
- **Spot Instances**: Purchase spare capacity at reduced prices, suitable for flexible, interruption-tolerant tasks.
- Additional options such as Savings Plans allow further customization and cost control.

## Security Groups

- Security groups act as virtual firewalls that control inbound and outbound traffic to EC2 instances.
- You can specify allowed IP ranges, ports, and protocols; security groups are stateful (responses to allowed inbound traffic are automatically permitted).
- Security groups provide an essential layer of defense for EC2 resources.

## Key Pairs

- Key pairs are used for secure SSH access to EC2 instances running Linux or to decrypt administrator passwords for Windows instances.
- AWS stores the public key, while the user retains the private key, which is required for authentication.
- It is critical to safeguard private keys and avoid sharing them or storing them insecurely.

## Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS)

- Amazon EBS offers persistent block storage volumes for EC2 instances.
- EBS volumes can be attached, detached, and resized independently of instances, providing flexible and durable storage.
- Snapshot functionality allows you to back up EBS volumes for disaster recovery, migration, or cloning.
- EBS provides several volume types optimized for performance, throughput, or cost.

 Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) provides scalable object storage for a wide range of use cases, including backup, archival, analytics, and hosting static content.[3][7]

## Buckets & Objects

- **Buckets** are containers for storing objects (files) in S3. Each bucket must have a globally unique name and is created in a specific AWS Region.
- **Objects** consist of data, metadata, a key (unique identifier), and a version ID if versioning is enabled. There is no limit to the number of objects you can store in a bucket, and each object can be up to 5 TB.[6][7][3]

## Storage Classes

- S3 offers multiple storage classes to optimize cost and performance:
  - **S3 Standard**: For frequently accessed data.
  - **S3 Intelligent-Tiering**: Automatically moves data between access tiers based on usage.
  - **S3 Standard-IA (Infrequent Access)**: For less frequently accessed but critical data.
  - **S3 One Zone-IA**: Data is stored in a single AZ, suitable for recreatable, infrequent data.
  - **S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval**: For archive data needing instant access.
  - **S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval**: Long-term archival with flexible retrieval times.
  - **S3 Glacier Deep Archive**: Lowest cost, long-term archival, retrieval in hours.
  - **S3 Outposts/Express One Zone**: For on-premises or high-performance access in local zones.[1][2][5]

## Lifecycle Policies

- Lifecycle policies automate transitions of objects between storage classes, enable expiration or deletion, and reduce costs by managing data retention.
- Configure policies at the bucket or prefix level to move or delete objects on a schedule based on rules you define.[2][3]

## Versioning

- Versioning keeps multiple variants of an object in a bucket, protecting against accidental deletion or overwrites.
- Each object version is assigned a unique version ID, and deleting an object results in the creation of a delete marker rather than permanent removal.[7]
- Versioning can be enabled or suspended per bucket.

## Static Website Hosting

- S3 buckets can host static websites by storing HTML, CSS, images, and JavaScript files.
- Enable static website hosting in the bucket properties, designate an index and error document, and configure public access permissions.[3]
- The bucket provides an endpoint to access the hosted site.

 Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) lets you provision a logically isolated network within the AWS cloud where you launch and manage AWS resources securely.[1][3][7]

## Subnets

- Subnets divide the VPC’s IP address range into smaller segments for grouping resources.
- Each subnet resides entirely in one Availability Zone, supporting zonal isolation and high availability.
- Public subnets route traffic through an Internet Gateway, while private subnets do not allow direct internet access.[3][6]

## Route Tables

- Route tables define how network traffic is directed within your VPC.
- Each subnet must be associated with one route table, listing destination CIDR blocks and traffic targets.
- Routes can direct traffic internally (between subnets), externally (to Internet Gateway or NAT Gateway), or to other resources like VPNs.[4][3]

## Internet Gateway

- An Internet Gateway is a horizontally scaled, redundant gateway that allows resources in your VPC with public IP addresses to access the internet.
- Attach an Internet Gateway to your VPC to enable outbound and inbound internet traffic for public subnets.[7][4]

## NAT Gateway

- A NAT Gateway enables instances in a private subnet to access the internet or other AWS services, while preventing inbound access from the internet.
- NAT Gateway is highly available and scales automatically with traffic.[4][7]

## Security Groups vs Network ACLs (NACLs)

- **Security Groups** are stateful, instance-level firewalls controlling inbound/outbound traffic; changes are reflected immediately, and return traffic is automatically allowed if initiated by the instance.
- **Network ACLs (NACLs)** are stateless, subnet-level filters; they require explicit inbound and outbound rules, and apply to all resources within a subnet.
- Use security groups for granular instance protection and NACLs for network-wide controls.[6][9][4]

## VPC Peering

- VPC Peering lets you privately connect two VPCs, either in the same or different AWS accounts and regions.
- Communication between VPCs is routed using private IP addresses, without traversing the public internet.
- Peering does not support transitive routing; each connection is direct and must be configured individually.[3][6]

Amazon CloudFront is a content delivery network (CDN) service that accelerates the distribution of both static and dynamic web content by caching copies of your files at edge locations worldwide.[1][3]

## CDN Basics

- CloudFront routes user requests to the nearest edge location (data center) based on network latency, ensuring faster delivery.
- Content is cached at these edge locations so repeated requests can be served quickly without going back to the origin server.
- This reduces latency, decreases load on your origin infrastructure, and improves overall user experience for globally distributed users.[2][1]

## Caching

- When a user requests content, CloudFront first checks if the content is available in the cache at the edge location.
- If the content is cached (cache hit), it is delivered immediately.
- If not cached (cache miss), CloudFront fetches the content from the origin server, serves it to the user, and caches it for subsequent requests.
- Cache behavior settings allow control over TTL (time-to-live), what headers and cookies are forwarded, and cache invalidation lets you update content before TTL expiration.[3][6]

## Origins

- Origins are the source locations where your original content is stored.
- Common origins include Amazon S3 buckets, Amazon EC2 instances, Elastic Load Balancers, or custom HTTP servers.
- You specify one or more origins when creating a CloudFront distribution; CloudFront retrieves content from these origin servers on cache misses.
- Origin Failover allows configuration of multiple origins for high availability, automatically switching to a secondary origin if the primary is unavailable.[6][1]

 Amazon Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) offers three main types of load balancers, each designed to serve different traffic patterns and use cases.[1][3][9]

## Classic Load Balancer (CLB)

- The original ELB option, operating at both Layer 4 (transport) and Layer 7 (application).
- Distributes incoming traffic across multiple EC2 instances for basic load balancing.
- Supports HTTP, HTTPS, TCP, and SSL.
- Limited features compared to newer load balancers; AWS recommends using ALB or NLB for most scenarios.
- Suitable for legacy applications and environments, especially those using EC2-Classic.

## Application Load Balancer (ALB)

- Works at Layer 7 (application layer), designed for HTTP and HTTPS traffic.
- Offers advanced routing capabilities including path-based and host-based routing.
- Supports routing to multiple target types like EC2 instances, containers (ECS), and Lambda functions.
- Supports WebSockets, HTTP/2, and gRPC.
- Ideal for microservices, container-based architectures, and applications requiring content-based routing.
- Provides performance improvements and enhanced visibility over CLB.

## Network Load Balancer (NLB)

- Operates at Layer 4 (transport layer), handling TCP, UDP, and TLS traffic.
- Designed for ultra-high performance and low latency, capable of handling millions of requests per second.
- Supports static IP addresses and elastic IPs, enabling integration with on-premises environments.
- Suitable for applications requiring extreme performance, static IP addresses, or handling volatile traffic patterns.
- Handles sudden spikes in traffic with minimal latency impact.

***

| Feature | Classic Load Balancer (CLB) | Application Load Balancer (ALB) | Network Load Balancer (NLB) |
|---------|-----------------------------|--------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| OSI Layer | 4 & 7 | 7 | 4 |
| Protocols Supported | HTTP, HTTPS, TCP, SSL | HTTP, HTTPS, WebSocket, HTTP/2 | TCP, UDP, TLS |
| Advanced Routing | No | Yes (path, host-based) | No |
| Target Types | EC2 Instances only | EC2, ECS containers, Lambda | EC2, IP Addresses |
| Performance | Moderate | Moderate | High |
| Static IP Support | No | No | Yes |
| Use Case | Legacy apps, simple load balancing | Microservices, container-based apps | High-performance, low latency |

AWS recommends using ALB for modern application architectures requiring advanced routing and NLB for extreme performance or non-HTTP use cases, while CLB is maintained only for legacy support.[3][4][1]
